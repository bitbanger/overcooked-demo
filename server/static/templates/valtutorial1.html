		Hello! In this study, you will be interacting with an intelligent agent called <strong>VAL</strong>. Alongside your chat window with VAL, you will also see a game called <strong>Overcooked</strong>. The object of this session is to teach VAL how to perform a task&mdash;namely, making onion soup&mdash;in the Overcooked game.
      </p>

<p>
Before you can teach VAL to make onion soup, though, you have to know how the game works and how to do it yourself. That's what this page will teach you.

      <p>
        You can move up, down, left, and right using
        the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
        using the <b>spacebar</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing
        <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>You can pick up ingredients (onions or tomatoes) by facing
            the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
          <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing an empty counter,
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you put the ingredient on the counter.</li>
          <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing a pot that is not full,
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will put the ingredient in the pot.</li>
          <li>If you are facing a pot that is non-empty, are currently holding nothing, and 
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will begin cooking a soup.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Cooking</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px">
      <p>
        Once an ingredient is in the pot, you can begin cooking a soup by pressing 
        <b>spacebar</b> as noted above. You can place up to 3 ingredients in a pot 
        before cooking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot to 
        denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done. Soup 
        cook time is determined its ingredients; every onion add  and 
        every tomato adds  to the cook time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the base 
        reward for any recipe is determined by its ingredients; each onion adds  
        points and each tomato adds  points.

        Once the soup is in a bowl, you can serve it by bringing it to
        a grey serving counter.
