We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you a phrase, the verb of the phrase, and a list of objects. You'll form a predicate-argument structure using the verb as the predicate, and for the arguments, you'll select a subset of the objects in the list.

If there are no objects in the list, you don't need to select any.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

OBJECTS: [pot1, onion1, tomato1]
PHRASE: "combine the vegetables"
VERB: combine
***
The best predicate and arguments for that are: combine(onion1, tomato1)
***
OBJECTS: [numerator1, denominator1, numerator2, denominator2, answer1, answer2]
PHRASE: "multiply the numerators"
VERB: multiply
***
The best predicate and arguments for that are: multiply(numerator1, numerator2)
***
%s
