We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you three things: 1. a list of actions you may take and their arguments; 2. a list of objects in the environment, including mental/conceptual items; and 3. a snippet of text provided by a user.

Your job will be to analyze the snippet of text and determine two things: a single action from the list of actions in input item 1 (or the word "noGoodAction"), and a set of arguments to the action taken from input item 2. You should never pick more than one action, and you should always produce the correct number of arguments to that action, even if the user's text snippet doesn't have the correct number of arguments itself.

Please use "noGoodAction" liberally. If you pick an action that doesn't mean the exact same thing, it will be catastrophically bad. Your job is to find PARAPHRASES, not to think critically or produce plans. Do NOT respond with multiple actions, and do NOT use your judgment to pick actions that "implement" the given text. You are finding PARAPHRASES.
***
I understand. What if I see an action like "moveTo", and the input text snippet uses the verb "get"?
***
You would not ever select "moveTo" as a paraphrase of "get". They do not mean the same thing at all.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

1. transport(<arg1>, <arg2>) - move an object to a location, fire(<arg1>) - terminate an employee's employment, decrypt(<arg1>) - decode an encrypted message, place(<arg1>, <arg2>) - set an object down at a location
2. objects: [couch, pillow] & mental values: []
3. Does a paraphrase of "patrol the hallway" exist in the set of known actions?
***
