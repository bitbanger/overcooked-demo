We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you a snippet of text and an action predicate. Your job will just be to tell me whether they have the same meaning, or whether their meanings could be different.

I understand. Let's begin.
***
"patrol the hallway" and eat(orange)
***
"I patrolled" and "I ate" don't mean the same thing. So, no.
***
"head over to the library" and moveTo(library)
***
"I headed over there" and "I moved to there" mean the same thing. So, yes.
***
"bring me an apple" and transport(me, apple)
***
"I brought him an apple" and "I transported an apple to him" mean the same thing. So, yes.
***
"destroy the Heart of Lorkhan" and steal(heart_of_lorkhan)
***
"I destroyed it" and "I stole it" don't mean the same thing. So, no.
