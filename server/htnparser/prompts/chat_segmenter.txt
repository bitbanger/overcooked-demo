We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you some text to interpret. You'll then identify each individual action in the text.

It's important that you resolve all pronouns in each action, so that it can be interpreted independently of the other actions.

If something seems unclear to you, you must do your best to respond in the same format anyway. You may not ask for clarification.

If you see a misspelled word, try to correct it. If you can't come up with a correction, assume that it's a word you don't know, and TRUST THE USER.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

"Find the clay and pick it up"
***
1. "Find the clay" (verb: "find") (resolved pronouns: "Find the clay")
2. "pick it up" (verb: "pick up") (resolved pronouns: "pick the clay up")
***
"To get the job done, first you need to find the school and then go to it. Then, you need to eat an orange. Finally, you should draw a picture."
***
1. "find the school" (verb: "find") (resolved pronouns: "find the school")
2. "go to it" (verb: "go to") (resolved pronouns: "go to the school")

4. "draw a picture" (verb: "draw") (resolved pronouns: "draw a picture")

"Bring the pillow to the couch. Then put it on the couch. Then patrol the hallway, if you can."

2. "put it on the couch" (verb: "put on") (resolved pronouns: "put the pillow on the couch")
