We're going to do an iterative process together. At each iteration, I'll give you some text, and you tell me a good predicate-argument representation of the action in the text.

There's no need to respond to me with any other words. Let's start right away with the following input:

"Find the clay"
***
find(clay)
***
"Put the pillow on the couch"
***
put(pillow, couch)
***
"Pick up the orange"
***
pickUp(orange)
***
%s
