A web application where humans can play Overcooked with trained AI agents.

## Installation

Building the server image requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

The server can be deployed locally using the driver script included in the repo. To run the production server, use the command
```bash
./up.sh production
```

In order to build and run the development server, which includes a deterministic scheduler and helpful debugging logs, run
```bash
./up.sh
```

After running one of the above commands, navigate to http://localhost:80

In order to kill the production server, run
```bash
./down.sh
```

The branch of `overcooked_ai` imported in both the development and production server can be specified by the `OVERCOOKED_BRANCH` environment variable. For example, to use the branch `foo` run
```bash
OVERCOOKED_BRANCH=foo ./up.sh
```
The default branch is currently `master`

## Using Pre-trained Agents

Overcooked-Demo can dynamically load pre-trained agents provided by the user. In order to use a pre-trained agent, a pickle file should be added to the `agents` directory. The final structure will look like `static/assets/agents/<agent_name>/agent.pickle`

If a more complex loading routing is necessary, one can subclass the `OvercookedGame` class and override the `get_policy` method, as done in [DummyOvercookedGame](server/game.py#L420). Make sure the subclass is properly imported [here](server/app.py#L5)

## Updating Overcooked_ai
This repo was designed to be as flexible to changes in overcooked_ai as possible. To change the branch used, use the `OVERCOOKED_BRANCH` environment variable shown above.

Changes to the JSON state representation of the game will require updating the JS graphics. At the highest level, a graphics implementation must implement the functions `graphics_start`, called at the start of each game, `graphics_end`, called at the end of each game, and `drawState`, called at every timestep tick. See [dummy_graphcis.js](server/graphics/dummy_graphics.js) for a barebones example.

The graphics file is dynamically loaded into the docker container and served to the client. Which file is loaded is determined by the `GRAPHICS` environment variable. For example, to server `dummy_graphics.js` one would run
```bash
GRAPHICS=dummy_graphics.js ./up.sh
```
The default graphics file is currently `overcooked_graphics_v2.1.js`


## Configuration

Basic game settings can be configured by changing the values in [config.json](server/config.json)
